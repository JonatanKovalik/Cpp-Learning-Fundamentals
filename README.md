## üìú Project Overview

This repository showcases my custom-built game engine developed from scratch in C++, alongside a small game built using this engine to demonstrate its capabilities. The project focuses on understanding and implementing core engine functionalities, including [mention 2-3 key areas, e.g., a custom rendering pipeline, robust input handling, and a flexible game loop management system]. It represents a significant step in my journey to understand the foundational elements of game development.

## ‚ú® Engine Features

* **[Engine Feature 1]:** [e.g., Modular Rendering System (OpenGL/DirectX/SFML based)]
* **[Engine Feature 2]:** [e.g., Event-Driven Input Manager]
* **[Engine Feature 3]:** [e.g., Scene Management System]
* **[Engine Feature 4]:** [e.g., Basic Physics Integration (e.g., AABB collision)]
* [Add more engine features as applicable]

## ‚ú® Game Highlights (Built with the Engine)

* **[Game Feature 1]:** [e.g., Simple 2D platformer mechanics]
* **[Game Feature 2]:** [e.g., Interactive game objects]
* [Add specific game features to showcase the engine's use]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Libraries:** [e.g., SFML (for graphics/window), OpenGL (for rendering), glad, imgui]
* **Compiler:** MSVC (via Visual Studio 2022)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

To compile and run this project, you will need Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools installed. Ensure you have correctly configured the necessary external libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-CustomGameEngine-And-Game.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-CustomGameEngine-And-Game.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Visual Studio:** Open the main solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.
3.  **Configure Dependencies (if external libraries are not self-contained):**
    * [Provide instructions for setting up SFML/OpenGL/etc., e.g., "Ensure SFML is installed and linked correctly in your project properties." or "Run `vcpkg install ...` for vcpkg dependencies."]
4.  **Build and Run:** Set the game project as the startup project, then press `F5` or click "Start Debugging" to compile and launch the application.

## üß† Learning & Challenges

Developing a custom game engine was a significant undertaking. I gained deep insights into [mention specific learning, e.g., low-level graphics programming, memory management in C++, design patterns for engine architecture]. Key challenges included [describe a specific challenge, e.g., optimizing rendering performance, managing complex object hierarchies, debugging memory leaks], which I tackled by [explain your solution, e.g., profiling code, implementing smart pointers, extensive testing and refactoring].
