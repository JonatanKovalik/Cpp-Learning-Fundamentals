## üìú Project Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my initial learning exercises and small projects in C++. It's designed to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental C++ programming concepts, syntax, and basic problem-solving techniques. Each subfolder represents a distinct exercise or mini-project.

## ‚ú® Projects Included

* **[Project/Exercise Name 1]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A simple calculator program demonstrating basic arithmetic operations and user input."]
* **[Project/Exercise Name 2]:** [Brief description, e.g., "An array manipulation exercise showcasing loops and conditional statements."]
* **[Project/Exercise Name 3]:** [Brief description, e.g., "An introduction to classes and objects with a basic 'Student' class example."]
* [List all other exercises/mini-projects here with brief descriptions.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Compiler:** [e.g., MSVC (via Visual Studio 2022), MinGW, GCC]
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these projects, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++ or MSVC).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals/[ProjectName]
    ```
3.  **Compile the code (using Visual Studio):**
    * Open the solution (`.sln`) file in Visual Studio 2022.
    * Set the desired project as the startup project.
    * Build the project (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and then run (`F5`).

    **Alternatively (using g++ from terminal, if applicable for simple console apps):**
    ```bash
    g++ [source_file_name].cpp -o [output_executable_name]
    ./[output_executable_name]
    ```

## üß† Learning Journey

These exercises have been instrumental in building my foundational knowledge in C++. I've focused on understanding [mention specific learning areas, e.g., pointers, memory management, basic data structures like arrays and structs, function overloading]. Each challenge presented an opportunity to apply new concepts and debug my code effectively.
