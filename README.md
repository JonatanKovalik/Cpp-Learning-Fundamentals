## 📜 Project Overview

This repository is a collection of my initial C++ learning exercises and small console applications, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and basic problem-solving skills in C++. It's a journey through my early explorations with the C++ language.

## ✨ Projects Included

* **ID Generator & Math Tool:** This is my first comprehensive C++ console application. It allows users to generate a simple 5-digit random ID after providing some personal details (which are used only for presentation). Additionally, it functions as a basic math tool, enabling users to perform addition (including multi-part addition for up to 5 numbers), subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation (`**`), and integer division (`//`). The application also features interactive console output with colored text for a better user experience.
* **[Add other C++ learning exercises or small projects here, if you add more files to this repository in the future.]**
    * [Brief description of another project if applicable]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Libraries:** `iostream`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`, `string`, `Windows.h`, `math.h`, `vector`
* **Compiler:** MSVC (via Visual Studio 2022)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the projects within this repository, you will need a C++ compiler (like MSVC available with Visual Studio).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Cpp-Learning-Fundamentals
    ```
3.  **Open in Visual Studio:** Open the solution file (`.sln`) associated with the project you wish to run (e.g., `FirstCodeC++.sln` for the ID Generator & Math Tool). If no solution file exists or you are working with a single `.cpp` file, create a new C++ Console Application project in Visual Studio and add the relevant `.cpp` file(s) to it.
4.  **Build the Project:** Go to `Build > Build Solution` or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
5.  **Run the Application:** Go to `Debug > Start Debugging` or press `F5`. The application will run in a console window.

## 🧠 Learning & Challenges

This repository documents my early learning experiences and the challenges I encountered while grasping core C++ concepts. Specifically, in the **ID Generator & Math Tool**, I learned and practiced:

* Basic input/output operations (`std::cin`, `std::cout`).
* Conditional logic (`if-else` statements) and loops (`for`).
* Function definitions and calls to organize code.
* String manipulation and type conversions (`std::to_string`).
* Working with basic data structures like arrays and `std::vector` for dynamic storage.
* Utilizing system-specific libraries (`Windows.h`) for console enhancements like clearing the screen and applying colored text.
* Implementing simple random number generation (`srand`, `rand`).

Each small project, like the ID Generator & Math Tool, presented unique problem-solving opportunities and helped solidify my foundational understanding of the language.
