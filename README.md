## 📜 Project Overview

This repository contains a console application written in C++ that serves two primary purposes: generating simple random IDs and performing basic mathematical operations. It demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts such as user input, conditional logic, loops, functions, and basic console interaction, including changing text colors for a more engaging user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Random ID Generation:** Generates a 5-digit random ID based on user-provided personal details (which are then used only for presentation).
* **Basic Math Operations:** Allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation (using `pow`), and floor division.
* **Multi-part Addition:** Supports adding up to 5 numbers in a single addition operation.
* **Interactive Console UI:** Utilizes `Windows.h` to clear the console and apply colored text for improved readability and user experience.
* **User Input Handling:** Prompts the user for various inputs and guides them through the application's functions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Libraries:** `iostream`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`, `string`, `Windows.h`, `math.h`, `vector`
* **Compiler:** [e.g., MSVC (via Visual Studio 2022)]
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To compile and run this application, you will need a C++ compiler (like MSVC available with Visual Studio).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-IDGenerator-MathTool.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Cpp-IDGenerator-MathTool.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Visual Studio:** Open the `Cpp-IDGenerator-MathTool.sln` (or equivalent) solution file in Visual Studio 2022. If no solution file exists, create a new C++ Console Application project and add the `.cpp` file(s) to it.
3.  **Build the Project:** Go to `Build > Build Solution` or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
4.  **Run the Application:** Go to `Debug > Start Debugging` or press `F5`. The application will run in a console window.

## 🧠 Learning & Challenges

This project was a fundamental exercise in C++ programming. It helped me learn and practice:

* Basic input/output operations (`std::cin`, `std::cout`).
* Conditional logic (`if-else` statements) and loops (`for`).
* Function definitions and calls.
* String manipulation and type conversions (`std::to_string`).
* Working with basic data structures like arrays and `std::vector`.
* Utilizing system-specific libraries (`Windows.h`) for console enhancements.
* Implementing simple random number generation.

A particular challenge was [describe a specific challenge, e.g., ensuring robust error handling for user input, implementing the multi-part addition efficiently], which I addressed by [explain your solution, e.g., adding more input validation, using a loop and `std::vector` for dynamic additions].
